# UI Fails

## Overview

**UI Fails** is a project dedicated to the art of intentionally creating and showcasing terrible user interface (UI) designs. Inspired by the [Bad UI Battles](https://www.reddit.com/r/badUIbattles/) community on Reddit, this repository serves as a collection of creative examples that highlight the absurdity of poor design choices. Our goal is to make users laugh while educating designers and developers on what not to do when creating interfaces.

## Features

- A curated collection of hilariously bad UI designs.
- Community-driven examples that push the boundaries of usability.
- Insights on how intentionally poor design can lead to humorous user experiences.
- Contribution guidelines for sharing your own creations of bad UI.
